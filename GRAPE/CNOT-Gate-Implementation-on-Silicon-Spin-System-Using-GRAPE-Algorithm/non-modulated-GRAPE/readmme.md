You can change the gate evolution time for 1,10,100,1000 microseconds
You can change the number of time slots as they need to be proportional with gate evolution times
Because we know that our prediction is good for the CNOT gate and it is a two qubit quantum gate, we can use SINE wave instead of RND. 
But RND can be also tried.
